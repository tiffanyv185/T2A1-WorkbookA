Agile project management is a flexbile and repetitive approach to planning and managing a project that emphasises on regular and continuous improvement, collaboration and ability to change (Atlassian, 2019). This is very different to other traditional project management, which often follow a linear process, known as the waterfall project management method. This method requires projects to move through phases sequentially which makes it inflexible as it is difficult to make changes or address unforseen issues once phases are completed (Radigan, D. 2022). 

In Agile, projects are divided into small, managable units of work called "sprints" or "iterations". Each sprint usually lasts one to four weeks and involves planning, development, testing and reviewing. Having sprints allow teams to produce higher quality of work faster and more frequently whilst being able to receive regular feedback and make necessary adjustments and improvements (Max Rehkopf, n.d.).
