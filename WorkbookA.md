Agile project management is a flexbile and repetitive approach to planning and managing a project that emphasises on regular and continuous improvement, collaboration and ability to change (Atlassian, 2019). This is very different to other traditional project management, which often follow a linear process, known as the waterfall project management method. This method requires projects to move through phases sequentially which makes it inflexible as it is difficult to make changes or address unforseen issues once phases are completed (Radigan, D. 2022). 

In Agile, projects are divided into small, managable units of work called "sprints" or "iterations". Each sprint usually lasts one to four weeks and involves planning, development, testing and reviewing. Having sprints allow teams to produce higher quality of work faster and more frequently whilst being able to receive regular feedback and make necessary adjustments and improvements (Max Rehkopf, n.d.).

<b>Implementing Agile for an API project</b>

<u>Ideation</u>

1. Planning: Involves breaking down the project into smaller and manageable increments, prioritising certain tasks and engaging with stakeholders to set the foundations of the project.
    * Vision: e.g. to develop a scalable API for an e-commerce website to enhance user expierience and increase sales.
    * Goals: e.g. Implement functions such as product management and order processing and provide comprehensive API documentation.
    * Engage Stakeholders: Identify and gather information regarding stakeholder requirements and expectations.
    * Create backlog: Compile a detailed list of user stories and tasks required to complete the project. E.g., Create user authentication, product management, order management and payment processing.

2. Scope Definition: An important phase in project management where the project's boundaries, deliverables and requirements are explicitly outlined and agreed upon. This ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the project can and cannot achieve.

3. Forming Agile Team: A cross-functional team is needed in order to deliver the project. Each role contributes to the different aspects of the project from the developement to testing.

    e.g. Team composition for API project: 
    * Developers
    * Testers
    * Product Owner
    * Scrum Master

4. KickOff Meeting: This meeting sets the foundation of the project, ensuring that everyone understands the goals, timeline and tools for the project. This establishes clear communication pathways. 
What typically happens in these meetings:
    * Team members introduce themselves and their roles.
    * The project objective's, scope and requirements are discussed,
    * The timeline of the project is outlined.

<u> Development and Testing </u>

1. StandUps: Daily standups assist the team to stay on top of their work, share progress and quickly address any issues.
